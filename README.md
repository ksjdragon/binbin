Personal Drive Web App

This web application acts as a web interface for a cloud storage service. Users are assigned drives with permissions to read and/or write. There are two types of drives: real and virtual. A real drive is a physical folder on the host, with all subdirectories of the drive correlating to real subdirectories. A virtual drive is an emulated storage space, with all files being stored under a single directory, and a directory layout is mapped internally in the database.
